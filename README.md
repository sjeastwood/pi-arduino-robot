# Pi Arduino Robot

## Overview
Code for a Raspberry Pi intereacting with six servo motors attached to an arduino.
Current test code using USB Serial interface to send motor angles of rotation separated by commas.


## Current Progress

### Working on

Using I2C interface to send data to the Arduino





### Planned Robot Stages

1. Manually moving robot by providing angle of rotation to the motors through python script on raspberry pi

2. Utilising keyboard and/or joystick + buttons for moving and selecting of motors

3. Using OpenCV to automate Robot
