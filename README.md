# What this project is
Code for a Raspberry Pi intereacting with six servo motors attached to an arduino.
Current test code using USB Serial interface to send motor angles of rotation separated by commas.

### To follow:

Using I2C interface to send data to the Arduino





### Planned Robot Stages

1. Manually moving robot by providing angle of rotation to the motors

2. Utilising keyboard/joystick for moving and selection of motors

3. Using OpenCV to automate Robot
